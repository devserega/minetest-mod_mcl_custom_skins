This mod is used to put custom skins in MineClone2 0.84 or greater.

Place PNG skin files in the textures folder. If the skin should be used with the slim-armed player mesh, include a complimentary file in the `meta` directory. The file in the meta directory should have the same name as the texture with the file extension changed to `.txt`. Add the line to the file `gender="female",`.
